# Very Deep CNN for text classification and sentiment analysis

Project for the Deep Learning class based on the paper http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/E17-1104 which presents a new architecture for NLP
which follows two design principles: 1) operate at the lowest atomic representation of text, i.e. characters,and 2) use a deep stack of local operations, i.e. convolutions and max-pooling of size 3, to learn a high-level hierarchical representation of a sentence.
